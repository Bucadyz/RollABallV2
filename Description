This is my finished Roll-A-Ball V2
I implemented a few new features to complete the unique feature aspect.
I added spring squares which make the ball jump when they are rolled over. To counteract this,
I have also added invisible walls so that the player does not fall off the playing area.
The other thing I added was pickups that increase or decrease the size of the player. To help get this idea across, I also increased
the starting size of the player, so throughout the game you can either get super large or somewhat small.
